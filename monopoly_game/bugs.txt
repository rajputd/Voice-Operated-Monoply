- Player landed on jail but wasn't moved
- Player paid $50 fine with $0 in account and then had balance of -$50
- Collect $10 from every player does not create negative amount when collecting
  from player with $0.
- Encountered infinite loop after resigning
- Sometimes proposed trade has to be clicked by tradee, despite not modifying
  the trade.
- Auctions don't trigger when clicking "roll again".
  They trigger at the end of the turn instead.
- When managing properties if you click any property besides the first one
  everything gets unchecked and sometimes you can't check any of the properties
  anymore
- Unsure how game handles "Get out of Jail free" card once you land in jail.
  Ideally, we don't want to force users to use the card if they want to stay in
  jail to avoid paying rent.
